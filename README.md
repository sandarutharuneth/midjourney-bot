## Run
On your discord server use slash command `/imagine` to get results

## Common Erros
> IF you have a console error saying about any payment stuff, It means your free usage limit already have been ended and you'll either have to wait till next month get free uses or you can purchase a plan from Replicate to keep generating.
> If you got the output as a black image, It usually means that you used inappropriate prompt to generate an image. Replicate does not allow such a behaviour and you might get banned from the platform. Use prompt wisely!
